A utility library to convert SVG shapes to paths and reorder paths by proximity

For usage, see `test`.

## TODO

* Handle transforms (now ignored)
* Handle masks (now ignored)
* Handle viewboxes (now ignored)
* Refactor code to allow using certain parts selectively
* Add more strategies for proximity
* Improve Node.js packing (add package.json and keep only `index.js`)
